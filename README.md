# Merryall Manse Website Project
## How to contribute
This project welcomes community contributions. It uses git to manage the source code and changes to the source code. From the source code, Jekyll produces the output that is hosted in the cloud and sent to browsers when they visit our website. Only git is necessary to make changes to the source code, but to preview those changes on your local system it's necessary to install Jekyll to produce the final output. Making changes to the source files is possible with any text editor, but text editors made for editing computer code are usually more convenient.

### Prerequisites
1. install git -- how to install
